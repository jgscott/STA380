## Outline of topics

### (1) The data scientist's toolbox

Slides: [The data scientist's toolbox](slides/01_datascience_toolbox/01_datascience_toolbox.pdf)  
Good data-curation and data-analysis practices; R; Markdown and RMarkdown; the importance of replicable analyses; version control with Git and Github.

Readings:  
- [Introduction to RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)  
- [RMarkdown tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)  
- [Introduction to GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)   
- [Getting starting with GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)  
- [Jeff Leek's guide to sharing data](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing)  

Your assignment after the first class day is to get yourself up and running on GitHub, if you're not already.


### (2) Probability: a refresher

Slides: [Some fun topics in probability](slides/02_probability_refresher/probability_fun_topics.pdf)  

Optional reference: [Chapter 1 of these course notes.](./notes/Bertsekas_Tsitsiklis_Introduction_to_probability.pdf)  There's a lot more technical stuff in here, but Chapter 1 really covers the basics of what every data scientist should know about probability. 



### (3) Data visualization

Topics: plotting pitfalls; the grammar of graphics; data visualization with R.  

Slides:  
- [Data visualization](slides/03_data_exploration/datavis.pdf)  


R materials:  

- Lessons 4-6 of [Data Science in R: A Gentle Introduction](https://bookdown.org/jgscott/DSGI/).  You'll find lesson 5 a bit basic so feel free to breeze through that.  The main thing you need to take away from lesson 5 is the use of pipes (`%>%`) and the `summarize` function.    
- Some R examples can be found in [datavis_intro.R](R/datavis_intro.R) and [nycflights_wrangle.R](R/nycflights_wrangle.R).   


### (4) Neural networks: the basics

[Intro to neural network slides here.](slides/04_neural_nets/neural_nets.pdf)  [Jupyter notebooks here.](notebooks/)


### (5) Clustering

Basics of clustering; K-means clustering; hierarchical clustering; spectral clustering  

Slides: [Introduction to clustering.](slides/05_clustering/05-clustering.pdf)      

Scripts and data:  
- [cars.R](R/cars.R) and [cars.csv](data/cars.csv)

Readings:  
- ISL Section 10.1 and 10.3 or Elements Chapter 14.3 (more advanced)    
- K-means++ [original paper](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/778/1/2006-13.pdf) or [simple explanation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means%2B%2B).  This is a better recipe for initializing cluster centers in k-means than the more typical random initialization.


### (6) Dimensionality reduction: PCA and tSNE

Principal component analysis (PCA).  T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE).  

Slides: [Introduction to PCA and tSNE](slides/06_PCA/06-PCA.pdf)

- [ercot_PCA.R](R/ercot_PCA.R), [ercot.zip](data/ercot.zip)  
- [tSNE.ipynb](notebooks/tSNE.ipynb)  

<!--
A few other examples we may or may not have time to cover in class:  
- [FXmonthly.R](R/FXmonthly.R), [FXmonthly.csv](data/FXmonthly.csv), and [currency_codes.txt](data/currency_codes.txt)

Slides: [Introduction to the bootstrap](slides/04_resampling/bootstrap_STA380.pdf)  
  
Reference: ISL Section 5.2 for a basic overview of the bootstrap.    

For the class exercises, you will need to refer to any basic explanation of the concept of value at risk (VaR) for a financial portfolio, e.g. [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk), [here](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/092904.asp), or [here](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/papers/VAR.pdf).

Supplemental resources:  
- Lessons 8 and 9 of [Data Science in R: A Gentle Introduction](https://bookdown.org/jgscott/DSGI/)  
- [Section 2 of these notes](notes/decisions_supplement.pdf), on bootstrap resampling.  You can ignore the stuff about utility if you want.
