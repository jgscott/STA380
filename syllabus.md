## Overview

This is the second half of a two-part introductory course on predictive modeling for students in the MS program in Business Analytics at UT-Austin.  In the first half of the course, you learned about predictive models for labeled data (i.e. regression, or supervised learning).  In the second half, we will turn to the following topics:  
- a refresher of some important probability concepts.    
- exploratory data analysis.   
- resampling methods for uncertainty quantification.  
- unsupervised learnig, i.e. learning to model structure in _unlabeled_ data.  

The course is intended as an overview, rather than an in-depth treatment of any particular topic.  We will move fast and cover a lot, but will focus on practical applications rather than theory.

[The course homepage](README.md) has a detailed outline of topics, together with topic-by-topic reading lists.

## Software

- Statistical computing: [R](http://www.r-project.org), which we will use via [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com), a free, platform-independent graphical front-end for R.  Make sure you have both installed, along with the [RMarkdown package](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).  
- Other software: please [install Git and create a GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).  You will use GitHub for version control and to submit your assignments.    


## Grading  

Your grade for this half of the course will come from a long set of exercises, due on Monday, August 19th, which mainly consist of analyzing some data, creating a fully reproducible report using RMarkdown, and submitting your report through GitHub.   


## Readings

The course readings involve a compilation of free, high-quality sources.  

The main reference is _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani.  The book is [freely available here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).  I'll refer to it as "ISL" in the course outline.  We'll also use other smaller-format readings on a case-by-case basis.  


Some supplemental references:  
- _Shalizi_: selections from [Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf), by Cosma Shalizi.  Another textbook whose author has kindly posted a free version on the web.  Referred to as "Shalizi" in the course outline.  
- NIST Engineering Statistics Handbook, [Chapter 1](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/eda.htm).  Yes, this webpage has a "Geocities circa 1998" look to it, but its discussion of exploratory data analysis is at least as good as anything you have to pay for.   
- _Elements_: selections from [_Elements of Statistical Learning_](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/), by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman.  A standard reference on data mining from a more statistical perspective.  Referrered to as "Elements" in the course outline.
