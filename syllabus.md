## Overview

This is the second half of a two-part introductory course on predictive modeling for students in the MS program in Business Analytics at UT-Austin.  In the first half of the course, you learned about predictive models for labeled data (i.e. regression, or supervised learning).  In the second half, we will turn to the following topics:  
- a refresher of some important probability concepts.    
- exploratory data analysis.   
- resampling methods for uncertainty quantification.  
- unsupervised learnig, i.e. learning to model structure in _unlabeled_ data.  

The course is intended as an overview, rather than an in-depth treatment of any particular topic.  We will move fast and cover a lot, but will focus on practical applications rather than theory.

[The course homepage](README.md) has a detailed outline of topics, together with topic-by-topic reading lists.


## Software

- Statistical computing: [R](http://www.r-project.org), which we will use via [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com), a free, platform-independent graphical front-end for R.  Make sure you have both installed, along with the [RMarkdown package](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).  
- Other software: please [install Git and create a GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).  You will use GitHub for version control and to submit your assignments.    


## Grading

Your grade for this half of the course will come from a long set of [exercises](exercises/), due on Sunday, August 18th, which consist of analyzing several different data sets, creating a fully reproducible report using RMarkdown, and submitting your report through GitHub.   

There is no final exam.  Attendance plays no formal role in grading, although you are unlikely to do well on the exercises if you do not attend and follow the examples in class.  


## Readings

The course readings involve a compilation of free, high-quality sources.  

The main reference is _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_ by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani.  The book is [freely available here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).  I'll refer to it as "ISL" in the course outline.  We'll also use other smaller-format readings on a case-by-case basis.  


Some supplemental references:  
- _Shalizi_: selections from [Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf), by Cosma Shalizi.  Another textbook whose author has kindly posted a free version on the web.  Referred to as "Shalizi" in the course outline.  
- _Elements_: selections from [_Elements of Statistical Learning_](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/), by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman.  A standard reference on data mining from a more statistical perspective.  Referrered to as "Elements" in the course outline.  



## Students with disabilities

Upon request, the University of Texas at Austin provides appropriate academic accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) is housed in the Office of the Dean of Students, located on the fourth floor of the Student Services Building. Information on how to register, downloadable forms, including guidelines for documentation, accommodation request letters, and releases of information are available online at http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/ssd/index.php. Please do not hesitate to contact SSD at (512) 471-6259, VP: (512) 232-2937 or via e-mail if you have any questions. 


## Harassment Reporting Requirements.

Senate Bill 212 (SB 212), which went into effect as of January 1, 2020, is a Texas State Law that requires all employees (both faculty and staff) at a public or private post-secondary institution to promptly report any knowledge of any incidents of sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating violence, or stalking “committed by or against a person who was a student enrolled at or an employee of the institution at the time of the incident". Please note that both the instructor and the TA for this class are classified by SB 212 as mandatory reporters. That means we MUST share with the Title IX office any information about sexual harassment/assault that is shared with us by a student—whether in-person, via electronic communication, or as part of any class assignment. Note that a report to the Title IX office does not obligate a victim to take any action, but this type of information CANNOT be kept strictly confidential except when shared with designated “confidential employees.” A confidential employee is someone a student can go to and talk about a Title IX matter without triggering any obligation by that employee to have to report the situation so that it will be investigated. A list of confidential employees is available on the Title IX website. The professor and TA for this class are NOT designated confidential employees per SB 212.
